CRITICAL CONSTRAINT (must follow):
- The returned action specs will be used to construct Python dataclass actions.
- Any unexpected field will cause a runtime error.
- Therefore, you MUST output minimal action specs:
  - Always include ONLY: {"type": "<ActionType>"}.
  - Only include extra fields if you are absolutely sure they are valid dataclass fields for that action.

Safe parameterization (ONLY these are allowed as extra fields):
- For Computing ONLY, you may optionally include:
  mode (auto|agg|expr), out_var, agg, column, row_key, expr, missing_as_zero, use_llm

For all other action types:
- Do NOT include any extra keys besides "type".

Return STRICT JSON exactly:

{
  "action_specs": [
    {"type": "<ActionType>"},
    ...
  ]
}

Constraints:
- Return 1 to {topk} action_specs.
- No keys like 'rationale', 'params', 'comment', 'why', 'confidence'.
- No nested wrappers. No additional text.
